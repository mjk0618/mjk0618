- Neural Machine Translation

I am studying NLP to address the challenges posed by language barriers. To ensure seamless learning without linguistic hindrances, I'm particularly fascinated by neural translation models that can accurately translate domain-specific knowledge and professional terminology, taking context into account. I believe that the one of the key factors to enhancing the performance of an AI model lies in its training data. Therefore, I'm also keen on collecting and analyzing data that is optimally suited for the specific task at hand.


*Until the knowledge gap caused by language barriers is bridged ...*
